# Kindle Helper Scripts

When I got my kindle, I started adding highlights and annotations, but wanted to get them out of my kindle, and into separate text files (which was a convention I'd been using for a while). 

[This blog post](http://jane.dallaway.com/kindle-getting-the-notes-and-highlights-for-a) explains the history and the things I tried and this repo contains the applescript file that I am currently using.

## The original aims were
1. To use the My Clippings.txt file so I got all the highlights/annotations
2. To produce a text file per book listing highlights and annotations ordered by location
3. Optionally add the location to the end of the highlight/annotation

This script achieves all of these

## Known Issues
1. For large My Clippings.txt files, it takes quite a long time and is quite memory hungry. I've tried to do some memory clean-up but applescript isn't something I'm all that familiar with
